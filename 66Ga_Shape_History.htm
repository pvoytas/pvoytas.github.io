<h2 align="left"> Words:</h2>
<p align="left">There are 4 existing (3 decent 
statistics) measurements of the gallium spectrum shape. These are:</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">These were all thesis projects, and we have copies 
of the theses (VanNeste's in Dutch :( ) <br></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Camp and Langer measured the shape and found a 
deviation from the allowed shape (including an extra, completely unphysically 
motivated (1+b/w) term). Only shape factor graphs presented. We obtained the 
shape factor data by digitizing his graph.<br></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Sidhu measured gallium to check their 
spectrometer. Kurie plot and shape factor graphs both presented. They found no 
significant deviation from the allowed shape. We digitized both the Kurie plot 
and the shape factor plot.<br></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">van Neste measured results which claimed to refute 
the un-physical term camp and langer claimed, but did observe non-allowed shape 
as well. No spectra or Kurie plots, only shape factor graphs and tables of 
coefficients. Unfortunately, the shape factors that seem to be indicated in the 
figures in this work cannot be obtained from the coefficients of the shape 
factor reported in tables in the work. We obtained the shape factor coefficients 
by digitizing his graphs and fitting with a function of the form 
1+a*w+b*w^2+c/w.<br></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Rehfield claims to have measured a spectrum in 
complete agreement with the van Neste shape factor. Only Kurie plot presented. 
In this case, there were hundreds of data points, and an excellent (by eye) 
linear fit to the data. We therefore only digitized the line and worked from 
there.<br></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">What we have done is tried to reconstruct back to 
a form we can compare to an allowed spectrum. In general our procedure has been 
as follows:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">when we have only a shape factor 
(=N(w,Z)/(F(z,w)*p^2*(w-w0)^2) ), we have multiplied back out to get N(w,Z), 
using a modern fermi function (since it's not always clear what people used, and 
we find small—(not fully quantified)--differences between our modern function 
and typical functions used at those times). </p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">In each panel below the results are compared to 
the same allowed spectrum. The historical data is least-squares fit over the 
data range to the allowed spectrum with a single scale factor. (Horizontal axis 
is w=etot/0.511 + 1</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">The order of plots is:</p>
