<h2 align="left">Every year:</h2>
<p align="left">Before classes start, contact the dual-degree liaison (presently 
Dr. Jeremiah Williams) to let him know that this is a possible plan. If you are 
interested in 3-2 (as opposed to 4-2) scheduling is very tight and unless you 
tranferred in many credits, you&nbsp;must start your very first semester.</p>
<p>Pre-req's do vary from school to school and can vary from one program to the 
next so </p>
<ul>
  <li>start planning early</li>
  <li>explore what fields of engineering you might be interested in and find the 
  pre-req's</li></ul>
<h2>By Fall of Jr year:</h2>
<p>If you will be pursuing 3-2, you will usually apply in fall of your Jr. year 
so...</p>
<p>Have an idea of what engineering program you'd like to study and know the 
application deadlines (typically Fall for following fall).</p>
<p>If you will be applying for financial aid at the engineering school, know the 
deadlines for that.</p>
