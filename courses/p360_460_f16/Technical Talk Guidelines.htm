<p class=MsoNormal>Technical Talk Guidelines for Jr/Sr Seminar</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are actually many kinds of “technical” talks.  What
follows is a brief non-exhaustive summary of the kinds of technical talks you
might run into, followed by some good practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Public talk</u>: Audience that generally has little to no
technical background. You can’t assume much background knowledge or facility
with physics/math concepts. These are hard to do well and honestly. (45-60 min)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Colloquium</u>: Larger departments often have weekly
speakers from other institutions present on cutting edge physics they are
working on, but to non-specialists. So the audience is physics faculty,
scientists, post-docs, grad-students, undergrad students from all fields of
physics. (45-60 min)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Seminar</u>: This would be like a colloquium, but the
audience would be specialists in your field (e.g. I might be presenting to only
the nuclear physics research group when visiting a university). The content
would be more specialized and I would assume familiarity with many nuclear physics
ideas that physicists in other specialty areas wouldn’t be familiar with. (45-60
min)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Conference Talk</u> (non-invited, non-plenary): Usually a
highly technical and narrowly focused presentation of your results on a
project. Audience is usually specialists, often working on something similar. Almost
no time is available for motivation. (10-12 min)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Journal Club talk</u>: A group of people at your
institution who present summaries of research articles to each other. This is
to keep everyone abreast of recent interesting or relevant work in a particular
field. Often divided up by journal (you peruse Phys Rev C, I’ll do Journal of
Physics G, someone else covers NIM …). Often short, often several per meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Group presentation</u>: These are usually highly
technical and narrowly focused updates to your research group on a project you
are working on.</p>

</span>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the purposes of Jr/Sr Seminar, we will be looking at
talks that are closest to the Conference/ Seminar/Journal Club types</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Good practices:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mechanics:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Generally you’ll be using powerpoint or something similar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Length: A good rule of thumb is that it takes about one
minute (average) per reasonably composed slide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don’t use distracting backgrounds or effects</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Make sure the contrast is such that everything is easily
readable</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Make sure that the size of everything you present is easily
readable from the back of whatever room you will be presenting in. This is
especially important for axes values, labels, and notations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use equation editor</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use good drawing tools (Word drawing tools at minimum,
inkscape or equivalent better)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Learn how to copy figures you refer to at good resolution
and at good size.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don’t write out full sentences</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you use them, use bulleted lists hierarchically</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keep slides neat and clean and uncluttered</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Generally don’t show numbers (i.e. don’t substitute
numerical values for variables) in equations (unless there’s some specific
point like comparing the size of terms—even then there are probably better
ways).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Never rely <b>only</b> on what you say orally to convey
important results or points. Humans are distractible. If someone in the
audience zones out when you say something crucial, they will be lost for the
rest of the talk. Put it on the slides as well so they stand a chance to stay
with the rest of the talk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speak loudly, clearly, and slowly. <b>No, even more loudly,
clearly, and slowly than that.</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don’t trail off or speed up at the end of sentences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Content:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Know your audience and target the level appropriately. For
seminar, this means target an audience like you: Jr/Sr undergrad physics major.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Find a storyline or thread to organize your talk. There are
many different ways you could present the same material. One of the most
important things is to organize things to make it easy for your audience to
follow. Talks are best if they have a natural feeling of flow: one thing
leading fairly smoothly (in the logical-progression sense) from another.
Remember, the point of you presenting something is to make easy for the
audience what you worked hard at understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Avoid jumping around. If you need to refer to an earlier slide,
insert a copy of it near the slide you are on—memory is cheap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Know what you present on and don’t present on what you don’t
know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Minimize “hand waving” (see previous point). Faculty
probably set bad examples of this for one of several reasons. 1) Over your head/distracting
from main point 2) I don’t know for sure, but I can imagine how it might work
b/c I know a lot of physics 3) Arrogance</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Think back to what you didn’t know when you were researching
your topic—your audience will likely no know that too and it’s your job to make
it clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don’t deliberately raise questions you can’t answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is usually better to say “I don’t know” or “I haven’t
thought about that so I’m not sure” in answer to a question than to pretend you
know when you don’t. At least be sure to hedge because thinking through
something you haven’t thought about before while standing in front of a large
group of people is the second most dangerous thing in the world you can do.</p>
