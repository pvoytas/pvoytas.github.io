physics is the science concerned with the production and maintenance of 
temperatures much below normal, down to almost absolute zero, and with various 
phenomena that occur only at such temperatures </span><span 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">especially 
at temperatures so low that the quantum character of the substance becomes 
observable in effects such as superconductivity, superfluid liquid helium, 
magnetic cooling, and nuclear orientation.<span 
style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1"> <span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Low-temperature physics is also known as 
cryogenics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This field was 
furthered extensively during World War II when scientists found that metals 
cooled to very low temperatures showed more resistance to wear, thus cryogenic 
hardening was started. Using this similar process we have done this to many 
materials and created better acoustics, tools, engines, firearms and much more. 
We can even create cryogenic fuels such as liquid hydrogen.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We use successive magnetization and 
demagnetization under the proper combination of conditions which can <span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>lower the temperature to only about a 
millionth of a degree above absolute zero.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Getting lower temperatures means finding a way to remove more and more 
energy, which becomes very difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>When metals get less then a nanokelvin above absolute zero, then 
superconductivity occurs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can 
generate a current in a superconductive wire loop for years and years and it 
will not have any significant decay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>They lose their electrical resistivity completely. Liquids at this 
temperature become superfluids.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>They have no resistance to flow under certain conditions.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are many complicated theories and 
ideas formed about low-temperature physics.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some are the Josephson Effect, 
Bose-Einstein condensation, the quantum Hall effect, and Quantum coherence in 
mesoscopic<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and nanoscopic systems. 
Low-temperature physics also deals with thermometry and heat transfer of 
systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some applications of this 
are superconductivity for large magnets and low noise and high sensitivity 
instrumentation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These instruments 
have helped research in the field of biophysics, and in the search for magnetic 
monopoles and quarks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>MRI’s and 
particle accelerators are a few major applications resulting from 
low-temperature physics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
applications of this are slow in making, because of the difficulty in acquiring 
the materials needed to create mass amounts.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Continual research in this field could 
lead to superconducting motors and generators as well as superconducting power 
lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The future of 
low-temperature physics is headed toward dilute gas Bose condensates, 
unconventional materials, and many ideas in the field of 
nanoscience.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
