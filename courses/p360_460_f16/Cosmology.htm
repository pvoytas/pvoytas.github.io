<p wrap="">Cosmology is the study of the universe as a whole.&nbsp; The main 
questions cosmologists try to answer are: What happened at the beginning of the 
universe? How old is the universe? What is the size and geometry of the 
universe? And ultimately, how will the universe end?</p>
<p wrap="">          A possible way the universe started is the Big Bang.  This 
is what is believed to have happened today, where all of the matter and energy 
in the universe were in the same place.  Unfortunately, we can't know what 
happened before or at the moment of the Big Bang with physics we currently have 
because at that moment, the universe would have had zero space, infinite 
density, and infinite temperature, and the laws of physics break down because of 
it.</p>
<p wrap="">         As for the age of the universe, there are two possible ways 
to try and discover this.  The first way is to find and date the oldest object 
in the universe.  Knowing that, we know that the universe is at least that old.  
Currently, the oldest known objects are globular star clusters in the Milky Way 
dated to be around 13-14 billion years old.  A second approach to dating the 
universe is using Hubble's Law.  Hubble's Law is pretty simple, and says the 
velocity of an object traveling through space is equal to a constant H, known as 
Hubble's Constant, multiplied by a change of distance.  To use this to date the 
universe we must realize that at some point our galaxy and another galaxy were 
at the same point.  From that we can use this law to determine how long we have 
been apart based on our distance away from each other.</p>
<p wrap="">        There are three types of universes.  The first expands from 
the Big Bang, then comes back together in a Big Crunch, or Gnab Gib (Big Bang 
backwards).  This universe is called a closed universe because it has positive 
spatial curvature, finite volume, and no boundaries.  The second universe type 
expands from the Big Bang and continues to expand, but at time goes to infinity, 
the velocity of the universe's expansion goes to zero.  This universe is called 
a flat universe because it is spatially flat, has infinite volume, and expands 
forever.  Lastly, the final universe expands forever and if know an an open 
universe because it has infinite volume, negative spatial curvature, and 
infinite space.</p>
<p wrap="">          So what kind of universe do we live in?  We think we live 
in an open universe.  There are ways to find out for sure but most of the ways 
are impractical.  One more practical way is to relate the expansion of the 
universe now with the universe's expansion in the distant past by looking at 
galaxies far, far away.  This would work because the light from the galaxies in 
the past is just coming to us now.  Another way is to measure geometrical 
properties of the universe by making a very large triangle and seeing if the sum 
of the angles is 180 degrees.  A third way, which is also probably the best way 
as well, is to measure the angular sizes of galaxies, and depending on what you 
see, it may show different spatial curvature.</p>
<p wrap="">         Unfortunately there is a lot of uncertainty in all we know 
due to many factors.  One big factor is the existence of dark matter and its 
properties.  We know of its existence because objects seem to have more mass 
than the visible matter should allow and that mass comes from dark matter.</p>
<p wrap="">         Another big question in cosmology today is how the structure 
of the universe came to be.  For example, why are there galaxies, how come they 
form the way they do, and why are they where they are in space and not all 
together?</p>
