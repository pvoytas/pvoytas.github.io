<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><b>Astrophysics</b> is the branch of astronomy 
that deals with the physics of the universe and the physical properties of the 
universe such as luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition of 
celestial objects such as stars, galaxies, and the interstellar medium, as well 
as their interactions. In general this is a very broad discipline of physics 
that is capable of including many other disciplines. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><br></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Some of the interactions studied and current 
research in the area include how infant stars grow from the disc that surround 
them. The mechanisms involved in this growth are studied using different 
techniques. Interferometry, which uses light from two or more telescopes 
together to obtain a higher level of detail of the object being looked at, this 
makes the equivalent image as though it was looked at from a telescope with a 
lens with diameter of the separation of the two, or more, telescopes. </p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><br></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Another recent area of research many aspects 
involve direct observation of certain galaxies, using Hubble observations of 
local galaxies we are able to tell more about how these all of these galaxies 
were formed by knowing certain facts about a few stars, such as their brightness 
and color, subtle features about a galaxy’s shape can be found. </p><font size="1"> </h2></font>
