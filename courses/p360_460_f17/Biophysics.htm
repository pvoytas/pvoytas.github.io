style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt" size=3>Biophysics is that branch of knowledge that 
applies the principles of physics and chemistry and the methods of mathematical 
analysis and computer modeling to understand how biological systems work. Put 
simply, it’s the study of biological phenomena using the principles and 
techniques of physics. It basically focuses on the physics of organisms and 
their biological structures and processes. Biophysics is a molecular science 
which seeks to explain biological functions in terms of the molecular structures 
and properties of specific molecules. These molecules are the building blocks of 
living organisms which assemble into cells, tissues, and organisms.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.14in; LINE-HEIGHT: 114%; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font 
style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt" size=3>There are several different subfields in 
biophysics such as physiological, theoretical, and functional biomechanics. 
Physiological biophysics explains various biological processes such as the 
transmission of nerve impulses and the mechanisms of muscle contraction and 
sight. Theoretical uses mathematical and physical models to explain life 
processes. Functional biomechanics helps us understand the human body as a whole 
by looking at the relationships and interactions between the various body parts 
and systems that contribute to its ability to function.</font><br><font

style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt" size=3>A lot of the scientific success of biophysics 
depends on its ability to develop detailed physical mechanisms to explain 
specific biological processes. For example, the double helical structure of DNA 
provides a framework for an explanation of how genetic material is replicated 
and of how genetic mutations arise. Specific proteins mediate the unwinding of 
DNA and the assembly of a new strand based on complemetary base pairing of 
guanine with cytosine and adenine with thymine. If there is one mismatch between 
these pairs, a mutation of the gene occurs.</font><br></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.14in; LINE-HEIGHT: 114%; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font 
style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt" size=3>In functional biomechanics, there are two types 
of functional activity that the human body performs, global and core. There are 
many core functional activities that are essential to performing global 
functional activities. For example, running, jumping, reaching, pushing, 
walking, and throwing along with many other activities all combine together in 
order to allow global activities to occur such as doing things around the house, 
getting ready in the morning, and recreational and sport activities. Something 
as simple as standing and balancing is actually quite complex when it’s broken 
down into the different aspects that are required for this action to take place. 
Biomechanics evaluates the motion of living organisms and the actions and forces 
on it. It’s a combination of several different fields including anatomy, 
kinematics, kinesiology and kinetics.</font><br></p>
