style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN">In 
March 2006 Purdue University opened an investigation into "extremely serious" 
concerns regarding Taleyarkhan's research. This is usually not a good 
thing.&nbsp;Brian Naranjo, a graduate student in Seth Putterman's lab at UCLA 
said his analysis of data from the last scientific paper that was published by 
Dr. Taleyarkhan's group showed a chance of less than one in 10 million that the 
emission pattern could have been generated by fusion. The pattern of particles 
seen in the experiment much more closely matched that given off by californium, 
a radioactive element that is used in Dr. Taleyarkhan's laboratory. &nbsp;To 
disprove this contention, Taleyarkhan intentionally exposed his device to a 
Californium-252 source and showed that the resulting spectra were different than 
those in his earlier publications.<br><br>Purdue faculty members Lefteri 
Tsoukalas and Tatjana Jevremovic say that they seriously doubt the reality of 
the bubble-fusion effect. Since his arrival at the university, they say, 
Taleyarkhan has declined to share the raw data he claims to have obtained in 
successful experiments on shared equipment. The faculty members add that he has 
opposed publication of their own negative results and has removed the equipment 
on which they were trying to replicate his work. <br><br>Purdue University 
completed their review in June, 2006, but declined to elaborate on their 
findings. "Any further action in this matter will be conducted as an internal 
matter under appropriate university procedures."<br><br>In February 2007, Purdue 
University announced that an internal inquiry had cleared Taleyarkhan of 
allegations of research misconduct. &nbsp;The Purdue committee conducting the 
inquiry said in a statement "that the evidence does not support the allegations 
of research misconduct and that no further investigation of the allegations is 
warranted." However, Purdue released no details of the inquiry and said it would 
not publish the report. Seth Putterman was displeased with this investigation 
because Purdue did not interview critics outside the university nor did they 
appoint external members to the review committee.<br><br>In March 2007, the 
Purdue University investigation of Taleyarkan became the subject of a 
Congressional inquiry. Based on criticism from Congress, Purdue decided in May 
to conduct another investigation. This time the focus of the investigation will 
not be on whether Taleyarkhan improperly omitted himself as an author on two 
scientific papers, but whether the underlying research might have been 
fraudulent. <br><br>In March 2008, Taleyarkhan filed a lawsuit for defamation, 
civil harassment and intentional inflection of emotional against Lefteri 
Tsoukalas and Tatjana Jevremovic. Taleyarkhan claimed that Tsoukalas 
discriminated against him because of his Indian ethnicity.<br><br>In April 2008, 
Purdue University turned over the results of their investigation of research 
misconduct allegations to the Office of Naval Research. Purdue would not comment 
on the investigation until the ONR responded.<br><br>In July 2008, &nbsp;the 
Purdue University panel announced that Taleyarkhan had violated research ethics. 
The committee concluded that Taleyarkhan falsely claimed independent 
confirmation of his experiment results. The panel also found that he added 
another person as an author of research, even though the person did not 
substantially contribute to the publication. The university committee denied an 
appeal by Taleyarkhan and took away his named professorship because of the 
research misconduct. Taleyarkhan was allowed to remain a member of the 
university's faculty but was not allowed to serve as a major professor for 
graduate students for at least three years.<br><br>Taleyarkhan published again 
in Nuclear Engineering and Design, refuting Naranjo's finding, explaining that 
ice-pack shielding between the detector and the fusion neutron source, gamma 
photon leakage and neutron pulse-pileup due to picosecond duration neutron pulse 
emission effects play important roles in affecting the spectra of neutrons from 
acoustic inertial confinement thermonuclear fusion 
experiments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">On July 18, 2008, Purdue 
University announced that a committee with members from five institutions has 
investigated 12 allegations of research misconduct by Rusi Taleyarkhan. It 
concluded that two allegations were founded—that Taleyarkhan had claimed 
independent confirmation of his work when in reality the apparent confirmations 
were done by Taleyarkhan's former students and was not as "independent" as 
Taleyarkhan implied, and that Taleyarkhan had included an additional colleague's 
name on one of his papers who had not actually been involved in the research 
("the sole apparent motivation for the addition of Mr. Butt was a desire to 
overcome a reviewer's criticism," the report concluded).<sup

href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_fusion#cite_note-32">[33]</a></sup> 
Purdue University had previously said, in a press release in July 2005, that 
Butt's replication was independent from Taleyarkhan.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><sup><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></sup></p>
<p>Taleyarkhan appealed the conclusions in the report, but this was rejected. He 
said the two allegations of misconduct were trivial administrative issues and 
had nothing to do with the discovery of bubble nuclear fusion or the underlying 
science, and that "all allegations of fraud and fabrication have been dismissed 
as invalid and without merit — thereby supporting the underlying science and 
experimental data as being on solid ground".<sup

<p>The director of the Hungarian company responsible for the toxic waste that 
flooded villages last week has been arrested as authorities race to finish an 
emergency dam to hold back a threatened second spill.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Hungary" 
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hungary">Hungary</a>'s prime minister, 
Viktor Orban, announced the arrest of Zoltan Bakonyi in parliament today and 
said the government was taking control of his Mal Rt aluminium company and 
freezing its assets. Bakonyi will be held for 72 hours, a government spokesman 
said.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>At least seven people died and one is missing after <a 
title="the sludge, a by-product of aluminium production, leaked from burst banks" 
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/09/toxic-sludge-hungary-village-evacuated">the 
sludge, a by-product of aluminium production, leaked from burst banks</a> of a 
10-hectare industrial reservoir last Monday.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Experts have warned a second flood could be even more toxic because much of 
what poured out in the original leak was water, leaving the remaining sludge 
more concentrated.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Speaking before his arrest, Bakonyi said the company had "observed every 
regulation to the letter".<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>A <a title="statement on the firm's website" 
href="http://www.mal.hu/engine.aspx?page=showcontent&amp;content=20101011_munka_HU">statement 
on the firm's website</a> said the walls of the burst reservoir met the 
prescribed standards, based on the findings of a technical survey carried out in 
1995.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Orban said the company would be liable for the damage caused. "We need to 
hold the company responsible for the red sludge spill under state control and 
its assets under state closure until all of these four tasks are handled," he 
told parliament.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>He said a state commissioner would be appointed to take over control over Mal 
Rt and manage its assets. Orban also said the safe resumption of production at 
the plant was in the public interest and was needed to save the jobs of 
thousands of workers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Officials said there had been no widening of the cracks overnight on the 
damaged reservoir. The National Disaster Management Directorate said that 
measurements taken in the past 24 hours showed no further movement of cracks on 
the northern wall. More than 500m litres of toxic waste is expected to leak out 
if the remaining walls collapse.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Gyorgyi Tottos, a spokeswoman for the disaster crews, said the effort to 
contain the waste was "a race against time" as further rain threatens to 
increase pressure on the reservoir wall.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Health authorities are warning the local population, as well as clean-up and 
construction crews, that the amount of red sludge dust in the air exceeds safe 
limits and say they should use protective gear.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Parts of Kolontar, the town closest to the storage pool, have become 
uninhabitable and more than 700 residents have been evacuated. Some 6,000 
residents of the next village, Devecser, have been ordered to pack a single bag 
and be ready to abandon their homes at a moment's notice.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>A spokesman for Orban said he hoped work on the emergency dam would be 
completed by tomorrow. "We have 4,000 people and 300 machines working at the 
scene so we are doing our utmost to prevent another tragedy," he 
said.<o:p></o:p></p>

speak of the remarkable regenerative power of nature, and of the unexpected

has cost over $150m (£90.5m) so far, and still continues. But the government 
remains determined to get that money back from MAL Zrt, the aluminium company.

class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>A result was an enormous amount of raw data 
that Dr. Ninov processed using software he had mastered at GSI. As the only one

class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>What he was seeking was a pattern that would 
indicate that krypton (with 36 protons) and lead (with 82) had fused to 
momentarily produce a nucleus of 118, which would subsequently decay into a 
chain of smaller elements. For all the technology used in the experiment, the 
next step was decidedly low-tech. Dr. Ninov recorded his observations by hand on 
two sheets of yellow paper.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Before an element can enter nature's pantheon, receiving a name instead of 
just a number, its existence must be confirmed by other laboratories. That 
summer, GSI tried and failed to find a 118 decay chain. Efforts by the Riken 
Institute in Japan were also unsuccessful. These negative results were not 
necessarily fatal. Events like these are exceedingly rare, and it was possible 
that Dr. Ninov and his colleagues had just been luckier than the 
others.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Then, in the spring of 2000, the Berkeley scientists tried repeating their 
own experiment. This time they found not a trace of element 118. Over the next 
few months, an independent review committee ruled out the most obvious technical 
explanations -- discrepancies in beam alignment, detector inefficiencies and 
flaws in gathering and processing data. Perhaps, it was concluded, there had 
been some problem with the magnet settings. No one at this point was considering 
the possibility of fraud.<o:p></o:p></p>

class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>What turned out to be the smoking gun was a 
computer ''log file'' -- a diary automatically generated by Goosy of everything 
that had occurred during the handling of the data from the 2001 run. According 
to this history, an analysis performed around noon on May 7 indeed showed what 
appeared to be an element 118 decay chain. But when the very same data were 
analyzed again, a few hours later, the chain was not there.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-add-space: auto" 
class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>A closer look showed that it was the earlier 
record that had been altered; page lengths were inconsistent, and the timing of 
some of the events was off. In fact, investigators discovered, the events passed 
off as a 118 decay chain could be manufactured by cutting and pasting a few 
lines from elsewhere in the file and changing some of the numbers. Records from 
the 1999 run also indicated that at least one of the original three chains had 
been edited in a similar manner -- by someone using the account 
Vninov.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-add-space: auto" 
class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>…<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>In the end, no one on the team emerged unscathed. As the final report put it: 
''The committee finds it incredible that not a single collaborator checked the 
validity of Ninov's conclusions of having found three element 118 decay chains 
by tracing these events back to the raw data tapes.''<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>But members of the group say it is routine in this type of complex 
experiments to delegate responsibility. ''The fundamental assumption is that of 
trust in the honesty and competence of your colleagues, especially if they have 
distinguished reputations, as was the case here,'' Dr. Loveland wrote in an 
e-mail message to Dr. Schroeder.<o:p></o:p></p>
