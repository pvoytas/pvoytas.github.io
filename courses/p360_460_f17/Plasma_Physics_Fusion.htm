<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in" align="left">Fusion is simply the joining together 
of nuclei to form a heavier nucleus. This is what occurs in the sun, where 
hydrogen is fused to form helium. Due to the binding energies, fusion is able to 
produce far more energy than fission. However, there are electrostatic forces 
between positively charged nuclei that have to be overcome in order for the 
nuclear forces to take effect. This means it requires a lot of energy to get 
this energy. Modern fusion reactors work at 100s of millions of degrees Celsius. 
The most advanced type is called the tokamak. These use a more efficient fusion 
reaction involving deuterium (H2) and tritium (H3) which fuse to make helium 
(He4) and a neutron. At such high temperatures, the deuterium and tritium are 
ions in a plasma state. These charged particles are able to interact with a 
magnetic field. The plasma is kept in a torus or donut shape in a vacuum by 
using magnetic fields. The magnetic fields also create a current in the plasma, 
causing it to heat to high enough temperatures for fusion to take place. As far 
as getting energy out, we aren’t there yet. The amount of energy given off by 
fusion isn’t even enough to even sustain the fusion. The Joint European Torus 
(JET), for example, is only able to produce an output 65% of its inputted 
energy.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in" align="left">There is vast 
potential in fusion as a power source. Theoretically, it provides a great amount 
of energy. Its fuels are abundant, deuterium can be extracted from all forms of 
water, and tritium can be “bred” from lithium. There is enough lithium on the 
earth to last at least a thousand years using exclusively fusion to feed the 
world’s power needs. In fact, the lifetime supply of energy for a person from an 
industrialized country can be found in 500 L of water and 30 grams of Lithium. 
It is very safe: specific conditions are needed for fusion to take place. A 
reactor won’t become uncontrollable, but the plasma will cool. Also, there are 
no greenhouse gas emissions, nor radioactive waste produced.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in" align="left">The sun is proof of 
this potential, which we have seen is not nearly tapped yet (we still can’t get 
out what we put in). The fusion power field is nearly dominated by ITER, 
originally standing for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, now 
simply meaning Latin for “journey” or “direction.” There are job opportunities 
for both US and international research (U.S. ITER and ITER). The largest current 
ITER experiment is the JET, near Culham, Oxfordshire in the UK, with a larger 
one to begin construction in France in 2009. There are several other tokamaks 
for research in the US including the NSTX at Princeton, Alcator C-Mod at MIT, 
and DIII-D in San Diego. Job opportunities for both US and international 
research can be found at usiter.org</p>
