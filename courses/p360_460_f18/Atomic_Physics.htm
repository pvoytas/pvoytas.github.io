<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Today my topic is atomic 
physics. This is a field of physics studies atoms as an isolated system of 
electrons and an atomic nucleus. It is concerned with the arrangement of 
electrons around the nucleus and the processes how to change these arrangements. 
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">The history of atomic physics 
starts with the discovery of spectral lines and the attempts to describe the 
phenomenon by Joseph von Fraunhofer. Later the studies of these spectral lines 
led to Bohr atom model and the birth of quantum mechanics. After the Second 
World War, atomic physics has dramatically development. The studies of bigger 
and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision 
process were realized by the progress in computing technology. Also 
technological advances in accelerator, detector, magnetic field generation and 
laser have greatly assisted the experimental work.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Now, atomic physics is a very 
broad area. It usually integrated with quantum mechanics, group theory, 
electricity and magnetism, nuclear physics, surface physics, physical chemistry, 
fluid dynamics, and plasma physics etc.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Currently there are many 
experiments/projects deal with atomic physics, and a one I am very interested in 
a group at the University of Colorado. Since ultra cold atoms and molecules 
comprise novel forms matter at temperature below a few millionths of a degree 
above absolute zero. And the group at JILA creates these novel substances and 
investigates their properties, behavior and interactions. They are trying to 
answer how do unltracold molecules collide? How precisely can we measure 
interactions between atoms or molecules in a BEC? What is the connection between 
BEC and superconductivity? And do electrons have an electric dipole moment? 
Etc.</p>
