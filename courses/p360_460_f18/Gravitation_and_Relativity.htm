<p wrap="">Applying relativity (general) to the theory of gravity and tying 
everything together into one unified theory.</p>
<p wrap="">Gravitation compels dispersed matter to coalesce, thus it accounts 
for the very existence of the Earth, the Sun, and most of the macroscopic 
objects in the universe.</p>
<p wrap="">General relativity describes gravity as a manifestation of the 
curvature of space-time. This description has been tested and proven correct in 
the solar system, where the static curvature due to the gravitational attraction 
of the planets and their satellites has been observed.</p>
<p wrap="">In general relativity, gravitational radiation is generated in 
situations where the curvature of spacetime is oscillating, such as is the case 
with co-orbiting objects.</p>
<p wrap="">&nbsp;– Gravitational Waves: Gravitational radiation is the energy 
transported by these waves. Important examples of systems which emit 
gravitational waves are binary star systems, where the two stars in the binary 
are white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.</p>
<p wrap="">-Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory: LIGO will 
detect the ripples in space-time by using a device called a laser 
interferometer, in which the time it takes light to travel between suspended 
mirrors is measured with high precision using controlled laser light. Two 
mirrors hang far apart, forming one "arm" of the interferometer, and two more 
mirrors make a second arm perpendicular to the first. Viewed from above, the two 
arms form an L shape. Laser light enters the arms through a beam splitter 
located at the corner of the L, dividing the light between the arms. The light 
is allowed to bounce between the mirrors repeatedly before it returns to the 
beam splitter. If the two arms have identical lengths, then interference between 
the light beams returning to the beam splitter will direct all of the light back 
toward the laser. But if there is any difference between the lengths of the two 
arms, some light will travel to where it can be recorded by a photodetector.</p>
