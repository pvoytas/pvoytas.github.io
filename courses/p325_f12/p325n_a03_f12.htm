<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. a) Show that when the recoil of the daughter nucleus in
gamma decay is considered, a better relationship between the energy of the
gamma and the transition energy is E<sub>&#947;</sub> &#8776; &#916;E –
(&#916;E)<sup>2</sup>/(2mc<sup>2</sup>), where m is the mass of the daughter
and &#916;E is the transition energy. Start with conservation of momentum (p<sub>d</sub>c=p<sub>&#947;</sub>c)
and conservation of energy (&#916;E=E<sub>&#947;</sub>+K<sub>d</sub>), where
the d subscript indicates the daughter. You’ll have to use the fact that mc<sup>2</sup>
&gt;&gt; p<sub>d</sub>c as well as the fact that to first order E<sub>&#947;</sub>
= &#916;E in order to make some approximations that will lead to the answer
above. Hint: think Taylor series expansion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b) Following the decay of <sup>198</sup>Au to <sup>198</sup>Hg,
three different &#947;’s can be detected. Their energies in keV (with
experimental uncertainties) are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E<sub>&#947;1</sub>:  411.80441 ± 0.00015</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E<sub>&#947;2</sub>:  675.88743 ± 0.00069</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E<sub>&#947;3</sub>: 1087.69033 ± 0.00074</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One interpretation is that there are two excited states of <sup>198</sup>Hg
that are populated in the decay, and that the &#947;’s correspond respectively
to the transitions S1&#8594;S0, S2&#8594;S1, and S2&#8594;S0 (where S0 is the
ground state and S1 and S2 are the excited states). If this is true, then we expect
&#916;E<sub>1</sub> + &#916;E<sub>2</sub> = &#916;E<sub>3. </sub> Using the
simple approximation E<sub>&#947;</sub> = &#916;E, this is not true, even
taking the experimental uncertainties into account. Show that including the
nuclear recoil from the gamma decays resolves the discrepancy (you can use what
you found in part a) to do the calculation).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. a) A nucleus has the following levels, starting with the
ground states and going up in energy:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3/2+, 7/2+, 5/2+, ½-, and 3/2-. Draw a level scheme showing
the possible &#947; transitions between each level (consider all pairs of
levels) and label all possible multipoles for each transition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b) Are there any of these transitions that can’t be made by
&#947; decay? If so, how might these excited states decay?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. An excited state decays to a known 1/2+ ground state; the
multipolarity of the transition is found to be E2. What are the possible spin
and parity assignments for the excited state?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. In a rotational band, the states lowest in energy are 0<sup>+</sup>,
2<sup>+</sup>, and 4<sup>+</sup> (from lowest to highest). We find
experimentally that the 4<sup>+</sup> state decays to the 2<sup>+</sup> state
rather than directly to the ground state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a) What do you expect the dominant multipolarity (E1, M1,
E2,…) of the decay from 4<sup>+</sup> to 2<sup>+</sup> to be?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b) What do you expect the dominant multipolarity of the
decay from 2<sup>+</sup> to 0<sup>+</sup> to be?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>c) Justify the observation that the 4<sup>+</sup> state
primarily decays to the 2<sup>+</sup> state by estimating (using the Weisskopf
single-particle estimates) the ratio between the probability of the decay in a)
to the probability of the decay in b). (Note: since these are rotational
states, the Weisskopf estimates should not be taken too seriously.)</p>
