<h2 align="left">Heading 2</h2>
<p align="justify">Saint Augustine (A.D. 354-430) in his work <strong>The Literal 
Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim) </strong>provided 
excellent advice for all Christians who are faced with the task of interpreting 
Scripture in the light of scientific knowledge. This translation is by J. H. 
Taylor in <strong>Ancient Christian Writers</strong>, Newman Press, 1982, volume 
41. </p>
<blockquote><small>
  <p align="justify">Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the 
  earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and 
  orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the 
  predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the 
  seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this 
  knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a 
  disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably 
  giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we 
  should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which 
  people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame 
  is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside 
  the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to 
  the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our 
  Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a 
  Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him 
  maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to 
  believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the 
  hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages 
  are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from 
  experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of 
  Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when 
  they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to 
  task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For 
  then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they 
  will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory 
  many passages which they think support their position, although <i>they 
  understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make 
  assertion</i>. [1 Timothy 1.7] </p></blockquote>
